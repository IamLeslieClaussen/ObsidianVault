For any of these projects, elevate them further by including:

- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Thoughtful UI/UX with accessibility considerations
- Detailed documentation including architecture diagrams
- Deployment to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Mobile responsiveness

Choose one that aligns with industries you're targeting, then build it incrementally while documenting your process. A truly complete, polished project is far more impressive than several half-finished ones.
