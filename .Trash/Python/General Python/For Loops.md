## For [[ Loops]]

Each value is a [[Datapoint]]
 
 For instance the first row:
 (Facebook
0.0
USD
2974676
3.5)

has 5 Datapoints
The collection of Datapoints make up a [[Dataset ]]
The table above has 5 rows and 5 columns

When we work with datasets, we must store them in the computer memory to be able to retrieve and manipulate the data points. We might think we can store each data point in a variable. For instance, this is how we might store the first row's data points:

track_name_row1 = 'Facebook'
price_row1 = 0.0
currency_row1 = 'USD'
rating_count_tot_row1 = 2974676
user_rating_row1 = 3.5
