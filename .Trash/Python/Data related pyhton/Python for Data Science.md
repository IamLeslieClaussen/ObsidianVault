[[SETS]]
In dictionaries, we have key value pairs between the curly braces; In sets, we just have its elements.

We can think of sets as unordered collections of objects without repetition. 

Unordered because it doesn't matter in which order the elements of a set are arranged upon creation, nor how they are displayed when we print a set.  

Sets in python try to model the concept in Mathematics. As such, we can do binary set operations like union (grouping together in one set the elements of two sets) and intersection(grouping together only the elements of both sets), among other operations like set difference and cartesian product.
