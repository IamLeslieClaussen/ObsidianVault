- Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action. Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions.2 We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”3 ([Location 1747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1747))
- It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.” ([Location 1853](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1853))
- If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure. ([Location 1863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1863))
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in. ([Location 1872](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1872))
- Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one. ([Location 1961](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=1961))
- Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said. ([Location 2164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2164))
- “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa ….18 Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.” Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. ([Location 2434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=2434))
- Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”6 ([Location 3029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3029))
- Your response tends to follow your emotions. Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. Two people can notice the same set of facts and respond very differently because they run those facts through their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason.5 If a topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making. ([Location 3318](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01N5AX61W&location=3318))
