What is an algorithm

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size

[[Time complexity of an algorithm]]: Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

[[Space complexity of an algorithm]]: Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

### How to represent complexity?
Asymptotic notations

-Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity

1. Big-O Notation [[O-notation]] - worst case complexity.
2. Omega Notation [[Omega-notation]] - Best case complexity.
3. Theta Notation [[Theta-notation]] - Average case complexity.


Big-O notation

The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation.
It also describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms. 

It has two important characteristics
- it is expressed in terms of the input
- it focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.
