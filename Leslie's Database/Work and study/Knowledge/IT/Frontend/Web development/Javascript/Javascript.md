# Objects 

Objects come in[[ key-value pairs]] that are in curly braces. 
```js
const myObj = {name: "leslie"};
```
In order to access the value of the object, we name the key.
looking at the above example;
```js
console.log(myObj.name);
```
Objects can store various data structures, including:
- [[Primitive data types]]: [[strings]], [[numbers]], [[booleans]], [[null]] and [[undefined]].
- [[Arrays]]: which are a type of object and can store a collection of elements.
- [[Functions]]: in JS functions are [[Objects]], they can be stored as properties of other objects. 
- Other Objects: objects can store references to other objects , allowing for complex data structures and relationships.
- [[symbols]]: which are unique and immutable data types that can be used as property keys for objects
