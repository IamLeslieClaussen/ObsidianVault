It could be refered to hardware, software or both

Hardware: Its just a computer that stores the webserver software, source code and some other stuff. The Webserver can process incoming requests using different protocols. Typically its the HTTP protocol. Which is the protocol used by the browser to view the Webpage. It can host multiple websites on the same server using the same resource.
