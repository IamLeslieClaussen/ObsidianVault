[[SQL]] enables us to pull data from many sources.

In many real-word situations, data is distributed across many sources. SQL allows us to select specific data and transform it to fit our needs. For example, working with spreadsheets can be difficult if the data we need to answer our question is distributed across many files. SQL allows us to structure our data in a way that makes it accessible from one place.

A [[database ]]can store much more data more securely than a spreadsheet or a text file. Unlike simply opening a spreadsheet, we actually have to "ask" for data from the database.

We primarily interact with a database using a [[database management system (DBMS)]] — a computer program to help users interact with data by giving the computer instructions through the DBMS.

We'll begin learning SQL with the DBMS SQLite. SQLite is a lightweight DBMS, and it is the most popular database in the world.
