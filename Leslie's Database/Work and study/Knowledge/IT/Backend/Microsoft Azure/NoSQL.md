[[NoSQL]]
Not only SQL or no Structured query language is the managament system, that is employed to manage unstructured data.

It solves 2 Major Problems:
1.Flexibility 
2.Scalability

NoSQL can be used for relational and Non-relational Databases.

[[Vertical scaling]]: Add more CPU, RAM, HDD in same system(Increasing the load of single server)
[[Horizontal Scaling]]: Adding more servers to process request.

NoSQL use Cases
- Big data and real time web applications
- Relationship between the data is not important 
- Data likely to be changing in future


Disadvantages
- Inconsistent Data
- Denormalized Data means redundant Data.
- Inaccuracies and Conflicts
- Does not support many important functions of relational databases. Eg
