[[Users and Permissions ]]

SInce everything is file, by defining permissions on files we can define permissions for everything. 
Permissions have 3 scopes
1.  Owner
2. Owner Group
3. Others 

For each scope, permissions are defined by a sequence of characters called [[file access modes]]
They are in order [[Read Mode]], [[Write Mode ]]and [[Execute Mode]]
